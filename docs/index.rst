==================================
Welcome to NEvoPy's documentation!
==================================

`NEvoPy` is an open source neuroevolution framework for Python. It allows
researchers and enthusiasts to quickly tackle machine learning problems through
the use of neuroevolutionary algorithms. In addition to being highly optimized
for distributed computing, `NEvoPy` is also compatible with TensorFlow.

Neuroevolution is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary
algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs). It is a vast and
expanding field of research that holds many promises for the future. Currently,
`NEvoPy` implements the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm
and a custom fixed-topology deep-neuroevolutionary algorithm, but much more is
coming.
