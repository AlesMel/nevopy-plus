==================================
Welcome to NEvoPy's documentation!
==================================

`NEvoPy` is an open source neuroevolution framework for Python. It provides a
simple and intuitive API for researchers and enthusiasts in general to quickly
tackle machine learning problems using neuroevolutionary algorithms. `NEvoPy` is
optimized for distributed computing and has compatibility with TensorFlow.

Currently, the neuroevolutionary algorithms implemented by `NEvoPy` are:

    * **NEAT** (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), a powerful method by
      Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving neural networks through complexification;
    * the standard fixed-topology approach to neuroevolution, with support to
      TensorFlow and deep neural networks.

Note, though, that there's much more to come!

In addition to providing high-performance implementations of powerful
neuroevolutionary algorithms, such as NEAT, `NEvoPy` also provides tools to help
you more easily implement your own algorithms.

Neuroevolution, a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary
algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs), is one of the most
interesting and unexplored fields of machine learning. It is a vast and
expanding area of research that holds many promises for the future.
