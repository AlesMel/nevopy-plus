<h2> Neuroevolution for Python </h2>

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Talendar/nevopy?style=plastic)

*NEvoPY* is a fast and intuitive neuroevolution framework for Python. It was 
designed to allow researchers and enthusiasts to quickly tackle machine learning 
problems through the use of different neuroevolution algorithms. In addition to
being compatible with TensorFlow, *NEvoPY* is also highly optimized for
distributed computing.

Currently, *NEvoPY* only implements the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting 
Topologies) algorithm and a custom fixed-topology deep-neuroevolution algorithm,
but much more is coming. This repository will soon be updated with instructions 
on how to install and use *NEvoPY*.

Sample neural nework generated by the NEAT algorithm to learn the XOR logic 
function:

<h2> Citing </h2>

If you use *NEvoPY* in your research and would like to cite the *NEvoPY*
framework, here is a Bibtex entry you can use. It currently contains only the
name of the original author, but more names might be added as more people
contribute to the project. Also, feel free to contact me (Talendar/Gabriel) to
show me your work - I'd love to see it.
