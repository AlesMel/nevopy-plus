*NEvoPY* is a neuroevolution framework for Python. Currently, the only algorithm implemented is NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies), but much more is coming.

Sample neural nework generated by the NEAT algorithm to learn the XOR logic function:

<h2> Citing </h2>

If you use *NEvoPY* in your research and would like to cite the *NEvoPY* framework, here is a Bibtex entry you can use. It currently contains only the name of the original author, but more names might be added as more people contribute to the project. Also, feel free to contact me (Talendar/Gabriel) to show me your work - I'd love to see it.
